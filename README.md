# Bird idintifier
Final project for the Building AI course.

## Summary
the Bird identifier is an idea for a app or program for identification of a photograph taken by the user to identify the bird species. The program or app should be user-friendly and easy to use. For bird watching beginners who has no expensive or high quality binocular, this app or program shoul mke it easier for the user to idenfity the bird species and some general facts about the species. 

## Background

As a bird watcher for a few years with limited equipment, such as high quyality binoculars and apps. Have problems to identify birds that are within eyesight reach due to many bird species can look quiet similar. There is different apps that have the birds species different sounds that is great but not good enough for a beginner to be certain of a bird species. Is makes is more fun to explore nature and to check off all the bird species you have seen.

## How is it used?

The user can be anyone intrested in birds at any level. Itcan be used anywhere where user can find an intresting bird to idenfity.

The solutions are:
* Gps for location track - birds are often in different environment that is habitatible for them, such as mating season.
* Sound recording - birds have different sounds and melody. By recording the birds noise, higher probability of correct or accuracy will be.
* Photograh - a picture taken and a machine learning method that can use some kind of neural network method with a large data training set of all bird species. This makes the progam able to give an output of the ost similar brid species compared with the photograh and the other parameters above.
* location time (Birds have a routine which is a useful variabel for us to use for identification of bird species. The species are the most active at different hour of the day) 

## Data sources and AI methods
The data scoure of location, bird species habitat and visits can be used from an website called [the species portal](https://www.artportalen.se/). Many bird watchers use this website to report their finds. Information they put in can be pictures, location, distance, type of activity, bird species, the time they saw the species and so on. 

## Challenges

What my project dont solve is the frequency of the same bird being at different location (then we need a ringmarker with gps on the birds. A birds nest is also something that should not show on the program to avoid disturbing the birds mating season and hatching eggs.

## What next?

More pthyon script that slves these problems to give out a accurrate output. The users data collection will also increase the machine learning. 

## Acknowledsmagents

Apps and websites is use today:
* [the species portal](https://www.artportalen.se/)
* birdNET
* Artkartan
* FÃ¥gelguidenBooks with sound, and facts and pictures of the birds
